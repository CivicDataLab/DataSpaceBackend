### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CivicDataLab/DataSpaceBackend.git
   cd DataSpaceBackend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash

   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run specific test file
python manage.py test tests.test_specific_module

# Run with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **mypy**: Type checking

Run these before committing:
```bash
black .
isort .
flake8
mypy .
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. Install them:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
